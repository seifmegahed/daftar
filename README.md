An ARP Web App to manage Engineering Business's contracting projects and resources

This web app is not meant to be deployed to a cloud provider.
It uses the server's filesystem to store and retrieve files, and might use web sockets in the future.
So Vercel, Netlify, or any other hosting provider is not recommended.
